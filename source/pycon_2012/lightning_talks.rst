Numba
-----
  * Travis Oliphant
  * Python compiler
  * For numpy and C extensions
     * Pypy not good enough
  * Dynamic compilation
  * Scipy needs a python compiler
     * Allows higher level SciPy
  * Numba 
  * Replaces byte-code with type inference
  * Uses LLVM
  * Dothoes codegen
  * Uses C function pointers
  * LLVM works with everything
  * Uses a decorator to compile
  * High bandwidth communication to llvm

  * Talks are bad (but not here)
  * Code for brain
  * No spec for the brain

Python 3 on Pypi
----------------
  * Brett Cannon

  * 54-58% of the top projects support py3k
  * Some are under dev, like Django
  * The goal was 5 years
  * 3 years was the stretch
  * Update your metadata, e.g. "Programming Language :: Python :: 3.2"
  * Public shame
  * pyporting guide
  * added u'' prefix to make it easier
