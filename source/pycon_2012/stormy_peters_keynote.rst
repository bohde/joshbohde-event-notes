Growing a Community
-------------------
  * As companies get involved we wonder about the direction of the community
  * Reach out to new people, because it can be intimidating
  * When you meet someone, you have 3 seconds to make an impression
    * Based on your hair
    * And then shoes
  * When you respond to a bug report, or mailing list post, this is their first impression
    * Make it a good one
  * Python groups are great for this outreach
  * Study says learning something new is worth a 20% raise
    * old job needs 20% more money vs. new job with new tech
  * Some like to be famous (cue chuckles)
  * Some get involved because they are paid to
  * Some for ideals of free and available
  * Stay because of the community
  * Community is better when you can measure the impact of members

Open Web
--------
  * Believes in an open web
    * Shows phone that boots to Gecko 
    * Someone in Mongolia wrote about how excited they were for access to books
    * Could send html books instead of text messages
  * People made huge sacrifices to make ease of use with open and free software
    * Stay up all night to get a modem working
  * Free != open
    * Just because it's free, doesn't mean it has the ideals of open software
  * We haven't defined what it means to have an open web service
  * I want you to host my data, but what kind of access do I need to make it open? 
  * You may create a web service that puts you into a position you don't want to
    * Give users tools along the way so that they don't feeel disempowered
  * We need to help change the world so we get fewer phone calls
  * Things to help this (Mozilla examples)
    * Do not track movement
    * Browserid (now Persona)
  * Backup is important, as well as delete
  * "Are you sober enough to publish this picture?"
