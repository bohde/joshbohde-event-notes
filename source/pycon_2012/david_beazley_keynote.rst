Let's Talk About (something diabolical)
---------------------------------------
  * Let's talk about Pypy
  * Python implemented in Python
  * Quite a bit faster because of magic
  * Mandlebrot runs 34x faster
  * Which one can you adjust with a pocketknife?

Thinking about Tinkering
------------------------
  * CPython has patches, extensions, ideas
  * Talking about GIL, etc, wouldn't be possible without tinkering
  * iPython notebook is an examples of this
  * Is it just "evil geniuses"? 
  * Can you tinker with PyPy? 
  * Can I teach myself to tinker with it using just resources available, part-time?
  * Building PyPy is challenging
  * Takes hours, > 4gbs of memory, might break C compiler
  * RPython is a restricted subset of the language, but can run as valid Python
  * RPython is defined by the translation toolchain
  * If you love Python, you will hate RPython
  * Uses type inference
  * Lists need to be of a single type
  * Pypy uses the bytecode interpreter and an abstract runtime to compile to C code
