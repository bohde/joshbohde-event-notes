Graphs
------
  * Uoniversal datatype
  * Probably not the best fit if you don't have a relationship

Python-Dev
----------
  * "Who talks to whom?"
  * Nodes are people
  * Edges are "responded to on Python-dev"
  * Centrality
    * Intuitively, the more central, tend to connect others
    * Dict to map person to how central they are
    * There's a fairly tight knit community, with smallers around the edge
    * Antoine Pitrou was the most likely to respond

  * Topics
  * Nodes are people and topics
  * Edges are "commented on"
  * Filter out too-common topics
