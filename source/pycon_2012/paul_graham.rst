  * YCombinator

Silicon Valley
---------------
  * The center of SV moves around the peopl who make the next generation of stuff
    * So, this room is right now
  * The frightening-ness of big startup ideas
  * List of 7 gigantic startup ideas
  * Scary, maybe I should do that recipe site instead
  * 

Next Google
-----------
  * Start next Google
  * Microsoft lost their way when they got into the search business
  * Google has been getting into the social network business
  * Nostalgic for the right answer from google
    * Seems based on Scientologist: "What's true is what's true for you"
  * Find tiny idea that turns big idea
    * Dinosaur egg
  * Search engine for top 10k hackers
  * Make the search engine the one you want
  * Don't worry about something that constrains you in the long term

Replace Email
-------------
  * Any big idea has a bunch of people nibbling around it
  * Not designed to be used the way it is now
    * Bell labs "Want to go to lunch?"
  * Now a shitty todo list
  * Tweaking the inbox is not enough
  * Todo list protocol insteayd of messaging protocol
  * Sending emails to yourself
  * Want to know what they want you to do
  * When does it need to be done?
  * Whenever powerful people are in pain, that is the way to make lots of money
  * Gmail has gotten painfully slow
  * People will pay for faster email

Replace Universities
--------------------
  * *claps*
  * Last couple of decades, universities seem to have gone down the wrong path
  * Expensive country clubs

Kill Hollywood
--------------
  * Hollywood was slow to embrace the internet
  * Internet beat cable
  * Bolted an iMac to the wall, found it better than a TV
  * TV seemed like it was designed by the same people who designed the thermostat
  * How do you deliver drama via the internet?
  * You kind of want to know what you're going to get with a show

A New Apple
-----------
  * If Apple won't make the next iPad, who will?
    * Empirically, it's none of the incumbents
  * It will be a startup
    * Not crazy, Apple did it
  * Steve Jobs showed us what one person can do
  * "Steve Jobs unrolled the future like a carpet"
  * The next CEO might not live up to Steve Jobs, but doesn't need to
    * Just needs to be better than HP, Samsung,  Motorola

Bring Back Moore's Law
----------------------
  * Circuits are going to get twice as dense, not twice as fast
  * Hardware would just solve software's problems
  * Need to rewrite it to be parallel
  * It would be really great by making a lot of CPUs look like one
  * The most ambitious is to do it automatically via a compiler
    * "Sufficiently smart compiler"
  * If not impossible, expected value is really high
  * Less ambitious is to start from the bottom
    * Build programs out of more parallizable lego blocks
    * Programmer still does a lot of the work
  * Middle ground is a semi automatic weapon
    * Looks like a sufficiently smart compiles, but there are humans in there
  * Make a market place, let people do it
    * Maybe make bots that will do it

Ongoing Diagnosis
-----------------
  * Imagine the ways we will seem backwards to people in the future
  * Seem barbaric to wait for symptoms to be diagnosed
  * Bill Clinton had to wait for arteries to be 90% blocked to find out
  * Launch fast and iterate may not work for medical.
    * Work on pigs first
    * Sausage company on the side
  * The medical profession will be an obstacle to this
  * Doctors are alarmed to look for problems that aren't there
  * If you start testing people all the time, you may get a lot of terrifying false alarms
  * Think this is an artifact of current limitations
  * Going against medical tradition

Tactical Advice
---------------
  * For big problems, don't make a frontal attack
  * "Are we there yet?", Haters
  * Notice that you replaced email when it's done
  * Start with small things, let them get big
    * Facebook
  * Maybe big ambitions are a bad thing
    * The bigger they are, more likely to be wrong
    * Don't identify, just think there is something out there
    * When the opportunity comes to move, move there
  * Blurry vision may be better
