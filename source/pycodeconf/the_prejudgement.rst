Intro
-----
  * 10 Years of Failures and Bad Ideas
  * Pre-2001: Ignorant of Software
  * ~2001: C is the best thing, Java sucks
  * ~2003: Learned Lisp
  * Designed a "more modern" C
  * Had curly braces, static types, but basically Python
  * ~2006 Built BitBacker in ~98% Python
  * Arc: C -> Lisp -> Python
  * ~2009: Ruby and Python 50/50
  * Tweet about frustration of integrating libraries in Ruby + Javascript
  * Frustrated by Python's lack of blocks
  * Shows a conversation between _why and Ryan
  * "Ruby isn't serious"
  * Frustrated with programming
  * q2 2010: Writing Tests
  * Show TDD using Ruby
     * Crazy Vim action

Testing
-------
  * Claim: RSpec is confusing
  * Never had this problem
  * Python based on SUnit from 1994
  * Thought Django views are not as advanced as Rails
  * Ruby is the serious one?
  * "A Python programmer rejects a new idea without considering its value. A Ruby programmer accepts a new idea without considering its value."
  
Choose Ruby or Python
---------------------
  * Ruby community more willing to pay
  * Move to that full time
  * Shows examples of ugliness in Ruby
     * @foo ||= bar
     * realization, it's how you do memoization
  * Maybe Ruby is well designed?
  * Generators, Comprehensions, Decorators, and Context Managers are easy to implement with blocks
  * Which language is complicated?

Emprically
----------
  * Realized back to ignorance
  * Judged languages before he should
  * Ruby's community is serious about testing
  * Rare opportunity to work with both
