Intro
-----

  * Aimed at all communities. 
  * "Kids are okay". 

What is Python?
---------------

  * Python = python language + community.
  * Includes IronPython, Jython, Pypy. 
  * Heroku blog post says it really well http://blog.heroku.com/archives/2011/9/28/python_and_django/

Who uses Python
---------------

  * Everyone. 
  * Scales up to 100k users, to a script to calculate budget. 
  * Easy to teach. Fits in head. Scales up well, and scales down. 

Where is the language
---------------------

  * ~123 accepted PEPs. 
  * ~80 builtin functions
  * ~285 documented modules. 

What's the Future?
------------------

  * 2.7 is the last release of 2.x
  * Py3k 
  * Proposals for Coroutines, async IO, cofunctions, daemon, asyncIO for subprocess, OS and Exception heirarchy. 


What should Python be?
----------------------

  * Should be the Borg, by borrowing the good ideas from other languages. 
  * Ease of use, simplicity. 
  * Adopt, but make it Pythonic.
  * Must continue to look outside the language


Things Jesse Wants
------------------

  * Communication (messaging)
  * Lightweight processes
  * Actors. 
  * Gevent, libevent, 

What we need
------------

  * Cleaner, more Pythonic APIs. 
  * Don't leak. 

  * Balance advanced users versus keeping it simple. 
  * Modernize standard library. 

  * Python is a conservative language. Doesn't blaze the path. 
  * Core language must be able to fit in one's head. 


Interpreters
------------

  * Pypy
     * It's fast. blazingly fast. 
     * Magic in the RPython. 
  * CPython
     * It's the cockroach. 
     * Simple, uncomplicated C code. 
     * Battle tested. 


Predictions
-----------

  * Pypy will become the dominant interpreter. CPython won't die, and it will be reliable. 
  * PyPy, CPython, Jython, and ironPython are BFFs. 

Python3
--------

  * Keep Calm, and Carry On. 
  * Python is over 21 years old. 
  * 5 years is nothing for migrating a community so big.


Community
----------

  * Cannot afford to be idle. 
  * Cannot be hostile, but welcoming. 
  * Get involved locally.
  * Be open to criticism, especially constructive. 
  * Look through the pile of vitrol, to find the core of truth.
