Overview
--------
  * Community recognizes work you do (meritocracy)


Meritocracy
-----------
  * People will use your work if it has merit
  * Anyone can build or be a leader
     * If they put in the work
  * Permission isn't (usually) needed
     * We allow experiments

Open Comparison
----------------
  * Writing Comparison Grids for sub communities
  * Compare packages for Django, Pyramid, etc.

Call to Action
--------------
  * Build it!
  * Be Nice
  * Others probaby won't build it, so you should

Early Decisions
---------------
  * Django Packages
  * Made during Django Dash
  * Decided to only manually add packages
  * Good decision?
     * Doesn't matter
     * 900 packages right now
  * Action is better than having something get debated
  * Probably better in the hands of the core devs
  * Gut instinct is often right
     * Can always change it later
  
Ecosystem Patterns
------------------
  * Mostly from Django experience
     * Django has many 3rd party packages
     * Compared to Legos
  * Django Core vs. Apps
     * Many batteries included
     * This approach is good and bad
     * Can get stuck with a heavy core
     * Promotes "one obvious way"
  * Django has well defined patterns for apps
     * App structure
     * App settings
     * Overridable templates
  * Reuse encourages innovations as 3rd party packages
  * Core is conservative
  * Best 3rd party apps get added to core
  * Grow fastest when there is a pattern for extensions
     * jQuery
     * CPAN
  * Pyramid
     * Smaller core
     * Core functionality as add-ons
     * Endorsed add-ons
     * Potential for rapid growth
     * Can deprecate, and allow add-ons to evolve
     * Don't need to wait on core
  * Pyramid's Ecosystem developed over time
     * Came from Pylons, Repoze, Turbogears

How to Grow an Ecosystem
-------------------------
  * Write "Best Practices" on how to write 3rd party packages
     * There is a big gap in this
  * Well-defined specs
     * Allow others to write upon a base
  * Sample code
  * Active community
  * Mailing list/ IRC
  * Docs
  * 3rd-Party packages catalog

Too Many Options?
-----------------
  * "There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it."
  * There can be many web frameworks
  * But there is often too much clutter
  * Document the differences
  * Deprecate bad packages
     * Hard to do in some cases
     * Recommend replacements

Fragmentation
-------------
  * Not all web
  * Science, games, etc.
  * Can't have too many interest groups
     * Diversity of ideas

3rd Party Packages
------------------
  * Best: Do one thing well
  * Usability
     * Good docs
     * Easy to install
  * Reliability
     * Tests
     * Help
  * Antipatterns are viral
  * Snippets is the biggest anti-pattern
     * Copy and paste code
  * Don't over-engineer though
  * Don't make the "kitchen-sink" package
     * Utility functions
     * Unrelated problems
     * More visible in HTML/CSS world
  * Do Be Pythoic
     * Elegance
     * Ease of use
     * Explicitness
     * Simplicity is why we use Python

Mentorship
----------
  * Provide positive encouragement
  * Put yourself out there

Diversity of Ideas
------------------
  * Differ from country to country
  * Other types of diversity
  * PyLadies vs. SoCal Python Interest Group
