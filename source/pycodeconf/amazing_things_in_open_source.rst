Overview
--------
  * Community recognizes work you do (meritocracy)


Meritocracy
-----------
  * People will use your work if it has merit
  * Anyone can build or be a leader
     * If they put in the work
  * Permission isn't (usually) needed
     * We allow experiments

Open Comparison
----------------
  * Writing Comparison Grids for sub communities
  * Compare packages for Django, Pyramid, etc.

Call to Action
--------------
  * Build it!
  * Be Nice
  * Others probaby won't build it, so you should

Early Decisions
---------------
  * Django Packages
  * Made during Django Dash
  * Decided to only manually add packages
  * Good decision?
     * Doesn't matter
     * 900 packages right now
  * Action is better than having something get debated
  * Probably better in the hands of the core devs
  * Gut instinct is often right
     * Can always change it later
  
Ecosystem Patterns
------------------
  * Mostly from Django experience
     * Django has many 3rd party packages
     * Compared to Legos
  * Django Core vs. Apps
     * Many batteries included
     * This approach is good and bad
     * Can get stuck with a heavy core
     * Promotes "one obvious way"
  * Django has well defined patterns for apps
     * App structure
     * App settings
     * Overridable templates
  * Reuse encourages innovations as 3rd party packages
  * Core is conservative
  * Best 3rd party apps get added to core
