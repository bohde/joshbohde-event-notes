Lightning Talks
===============


Vagrant
-------
  * Vagrant loves Python
  * Building and distributing VMs
  * Gives isolation, repeatability, and verification
  * Move dev to virtual machines
  * Move production ops scripts to setup environment
  * Vagrant command line, to manage life cycle
  * Designers can use it too
  * http://vagrantup.com

Testing CSS
-----------
  * Needle
  * Takes screen shots 
  * Checks them
  * Looks like normal unit tests
  * uses css selectors
  * Extension to nose, with selenium
  * https://github.com/bfirsh/needle

Pyparsing
---------
  * Time trial using Pypy
  * Search for integers in a string of random alphas and numbers
  * Pypy ~10x faster
  * Verilog parser (~16k lines)
  * Cpython (500 lines/sec)
  * Pypy (1131 lines/sec)

Pandas
------
  * @wesmckinn
  * Agile Tooling for Small Data
  * First need to small the small data problem before big data
  * DBs, Flat files, time series, mean you may want it
  * indexed data structures for relation data
  * Fast manipulation tool
  * Data alignment
  * Join merge
  * group by
  * Reshaping/pivot
  * In memory and fast
  * Meant for quant finance application backbone
  * ~26k loc
  * In productions since 2008
  * Data Analysis is dominated by thing like SAS
  * Lots of people want to expand in these areas
  * Operations to naturally select portions of data
  * Can plot data
  * Would love collaborators

DSLs
----
  * Peter Wang (@pwang)
  * Crazy crazy ideas
  * Would like Python to ignore some syntax where we can do whatever the hell we want
  * It might be awesome
  * Calling it extern
  * Just syntactic sugar
  * Hacking import hooks to make it work
  * .pydsl file
  * uses pyparsing under the hood to transform the dsl
  * Aimed at scientists
  * People want it: weave, numexpr
  * Everyone needs it
  * Let's Python assimilate into existing systems
