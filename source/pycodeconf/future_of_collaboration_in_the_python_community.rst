Mark Pilgrim is Gone
--------------------
  * He did feedparser, httplib2
     * aside: httplib2 was actually by Joe Gregorio
  * Dive into Python
  * Dive into HTML5
  * Other things
  * We lost a lot with him leaving, sad to see him go.

What Happened to his Projects?
------------------------------
  * What is the copyright?
     * A: CC-SA
  * What about his code? 
     * httplib2 is a big dependency of many projects
     * That's how found out he was gone
     * Pypi didn't host it
     * Google Code didn't host it anymore.

PyPI issues
------------
  * Too easy to delete a package
    * Dependency checks for that package
    * Request a project handoff
    * Other projects need to be notified
    * RSS feeds
  * Human moderation
    * Some can be automate
    * Burdens PyPI team

Repeating History
-----------------
  * Django-lint
  * Django-Piston
     * social factors caused no release in years
  * python.org
  * opencomparison.org
     * Host djangopackages.com  
     * How does this get maintained? 

Dark Future
-----------
  * Critical Packages Breakdown
  * Python packages vanish
  * Build scripts fail
  * Replace from caches/backups

Repercussions
-------------
  * Lose domain knowledge
  * Python can't move forward.
  * Social Issues
  * 3rd Party Community is just as critical as Python core

Not the Future
--------------
  * It's today
  * Legacy code with legacy packages
  * Build scripts fail
  * Example of NASA issue
     * caused project to go to ColdFusion
  * We have lost works of antiquity
     * Blame is moot
  * Stuff we make today is legacy in 5 years
  
Trust Issues
------------
  * This causes a lack of trust in Python
  * Without trust, we can't collaborate as well
     * The disease that will trigger zombie apocolypse

Solutions
----------
  * Money!
     * Sponsorships
     * Problems getting money
     * Applications
     * Focus on sprints
     * Code quality issue from sprints
     * Ongoing maintenance

Future is still dark
--------------------  
  * Community Managers
  * Ticket triage, etc. 
  * Needs core/senior developers
  * They are already busy
     * Examples pay people to do this
     * Volunteers may have life get in the way
  * Determining authority

PSF Paid Commmunity Manager
---------------------------
  * Proposed solution
  * Paid via the PSF

Repercussions
-------------
  * Fixes some problems
  * Mitigate social issues
  * Can still lose domain knowledge

Precedents
----------
  * Ubuntu
  * Fedory
  * Twilio
  * Github

Wants
-----
  * More reasons to trust  
  * More reasons to contribute
  * Keep projects operating

Call to Action
--------------
  * This is a proposal
  * Wants to see PSF project incubation
  * PSF provides seed funding for OS projects
      * Should return on investment
      * Preferably to Python community
      * Needs a viable business model
      * PSF is an investor
  * Choose from particapants in Django Dash & coding contests

Return
------
  * Gives OS code
  * Gives money back to the PSF

What this isn't
---------------
  * Covering < $100 for hosting
  * Things without a self-supporting business model
  
Examples Projects
-----------------
  * djangolint.com
     * Little setup requires
     * Uses github
     * Wants for all Python
     * Wants syndication        
     * How does it make money? 
        * Pay to analyze privately? 
     * Easy linting increases trust

  * readthedocs.org
     * Places in the 2010 Django Dash
     * Documentation increases trust
