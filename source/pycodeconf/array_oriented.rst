  * Made NumPy 

Why Python?
-----------
  * Fits your brain
  * Doesn't get in your way
  * Software engineering is more about neuroscience than code.
  * Fibonacci is just an Unstable Infinite Impulse Response linear filter
  * Shows numpy example, which is fast, but wraps hardware integer
  * Wants to make Python faster than C, as in a GPU or FPGA

Conway's Game of Life
------------
  * Interesting excercies
  * Shows an example of it
  * Array oriented
  * APL 
     * Grandfather of most array oriented languages
     * J,K,Matlab are descendents
     * Numpy is a descendent
     * Unicode glyphs
  * Game of Life is one line in APL
  * Array-oriented programming deals with arrays as a block
  * Shows numpy example
