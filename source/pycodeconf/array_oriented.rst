  * Made NumPy 

Why Python?
-----------
  * Fits your brain
  * Doesn't get in your way
  * Software engineering is more about neuroscience than code.
  * Fibonacci is just an Unstable Infinite Impulse Response linear filter
  * Shows numpy example, which is fast, but wraps hardware integer
  * Wants to make Python faster than C, as in a GPU or FPGA
