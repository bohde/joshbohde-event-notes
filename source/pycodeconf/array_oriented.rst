  * Travis Oliphant (http://twitter.com/teoliphant)
  * Made NumPy 

Why Python?
-----------
  * Fits your brain
  * Doesn't get in your way
  * Software engineering is more about neuroscience than code.
  * Fibonacci is just an Unstable Infinite Impulse Response linear filter
  * Shows numpy example, which is fast, but wraps hardware integer
  * Wants to make Python faster than C, as in a GPU or FPGA

Conway's Game of Life
---------------------
  * Interesting excercies
  * Shows an example of it
  * Array oriented
  * APL 
     * Grandfather of most array oriented languages
     * J,K,Matlab are descendents
     * Numpy is a descendent
     * Unicode glyphs
  * Game of Life is one line in APL
  * Array-oriented programming deals with arrays as a block
  * Shows numpy example

Numpy/Scipy History
-------------------
  * Numeric around ~1994
  * More features for array oriented computing
     * a[0,1], a[::2]
     * Ellipsis object
     * Complex numbers
  * Syntax matters
  * Aside: We need more numpy/scipy and core collaboration
  * Derivative Calculations in 1997
  * Came from MATLAB, but it wasn't memory efficient enough
  * Iterative update loop made Python nice
  * 1999 Scipy emerges
  * Python was better language than MATLAB, but lacked scientific libraries
  * Community Effort
     * Mostly from academics
  * Numpy emerged from Numeric in 2005

Numpy
-----
  * Data types
     * Collections of objects
     * Arrays
  * Statistics functions
  * Arbitrary Arrays
     * Column oriented calculations

Scipy
-----
  * Stats
  * Data fitting
  * Interpolation
  * Brownian Motion

Zen of Numpy

Pypy
-----
  * Let's not chase C, let's chase Fortran 90.
  * Example where Fortran 90 is 7 times faster than Numpy and Pypy
  
Question
---------
  * Coolest thing seen with NumPy?
     * Implant surgery planning tool
     * CT Scans, 3d vis
