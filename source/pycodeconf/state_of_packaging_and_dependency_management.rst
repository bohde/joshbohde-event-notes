Packaging
---------
  * Need to release it

Where To Release
================

Your Server
-----------
  * Full flexibility
  * People rely on you being up
  * Breaks deploys
  * Don't do this, unless you want to provide better uptime than PyPI

Github
------
  * Awesome for dev
  * Not for release
  * Not mean to packages, but source code

PyPI
----
  * Please release it here
  * Complain about it being down
  * 5 mirrors that are well updated
